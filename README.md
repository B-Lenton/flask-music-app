# Flask Music App

A flask app for CRUD operations on a database of songs:
- Add songs (Title, Artist, Genre)
- Update existing records
- Search the database
- Delete existing records
- View all songs

Having used Django before, but not Flask, this is a good introduction to the latter's usefulness as a framework. The plan is to take this project further in the near future.
